## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```

## What is Commit Whisperer?

Commit Whisperer is a CLI and API for crafting meaningful commit messages using AI.

By analyzing the current state of your project and any provided instructions, it helps generate commit messages that accurately describe your changes.

## Installation

To use Commit Whisperer, first ensure you have it installed as a dependency in your project:

```sh
npm install commit-whisperer --save-dev
# or
pnpm i commit-whisperer -D
# or
yarn add commit-whisperer --dev
```

## Usage

```ts
import { whisper } from 'commit-whisperer';
```

### whisper

The `whisper` function is the primary method provided by Commit Whisperer. It generates a commit message based on the project's state and user input.

#### Parameters

* **cwd** (string, optional): The current working directory. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* **useGitState** (boolean, optional): Whether to include the git state in the message generation. Defaults to `true`.
* **usePackageJson** (boolean, optional): Whether to include `package.json` details. Defaults to `true`.
* **message** (string, optional): An initial message or instructions to guide the commit message generation.
* **instructions** (string, optional): Specific instructions for the commit message.
* **includeGitDiff** (boolean, optional): Whether to include the git diff in the message. Defaults to `false`.
* **orgId** (string, optional): OpenAI organization ID. Defaults to `process.env.OPENAI_ORG_ID`.
* **apiKey** (string, optional): OpenAI API key. Defaults to `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`.
* **openaiConfig** (object, optional): Passed directly to the OpenAI API. Useful if you want to change `temperature`, `model` etc. You can also pass a `messages` array to override the default messages.

#### Returns

A promise that resolves to the generated commit message.

#### Examples

```js
const commitMessage = await whisper({ message: 'First commit' });
console.log(commitMessage);
```

**git diff**

Pass git diff to the LLM as context:

```js
const commitMessage = await whisper({
  message: 'First commit',
  includeGitDiff: true
});

console.log(commitMessage);
```

## Configuration

Commit Whisperer relies on OpenAI's API to generate commit messages. Ensure you have set your OpenAI API key and organization ID in your environment variables:

* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
* `OPENAI_ORG_ID` (optional): Your OpenAI organization ID.

## Advanced Usage

You can extend the functionality of Commit Whisperer by providing custom formatting functions and OpenAI configurations through the `openaiConfig` parameter.
